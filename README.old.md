# personal-portfolio

## Description
This is a website that shows off - get this - my *personal portfolio*! Also, it'll be the location where I share what I'm currently learning and what I wish to learn about in the future.
 
But before I'm finished, here's a list of some of things I'd like to learn, as well as some other portfolio sites I'll be taking inspiration from

### *TO LEARN*
Primarily, I want to get great at JavaScript, since so many frameworks are built on top of it. As far as frameworks go, I'm interested in getting a better understanding of Node, Express, and Mongoose as a baseline as well as Vue and/or React for the client side of things.

### *PORTFOLIOS I LIKE*
[Jack Jeznach](https://jacekjeznach.com/) - Landing page is a rollercoaster

[Matt Bell](https://mbell.me/) - Most like what I'm thinking for myself

[Ottomated](https://ottomated.net/) - Very simple, stylized
